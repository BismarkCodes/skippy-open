# Contributing to Skippy Guidlines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

    * Contributing to the codebase
    * Reporting bugs
    * Submitting a fix
    * Suggesting features
    * Becoming a maintainer
    * Helping out other people
    * Helping out with translations

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Welcome Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

    1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
    2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
    3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
    4.  Ensure you test your changes before submitting.
    5.  Make sure your code lints.
    6.  Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

    * A quick summary and/or background
    * A clear description of steps to reproduce the bug
    * A clear description of the expected behavior
    * A clear description of the actual behavior
    * A clear description of the steps to fix the bug
    * A clear description of the expected result
    * A clear description of the actual result
    * Notes (if any, possibly including screenshots)

People love thorough bug reports. It's a great way to get feedback from the community.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

A consistent coding style is important. It's a way to make your code look good and easy to read.

Below is a list of the rules that we use to enforce consistency:

    * 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
    * Use ES Lint to enforce consistency

if you dont have eslint installed, you can install it with:

    ```bash
        npm install eslint
    ```

Or with yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add eslint
    ```

if you use visual studio code, you can install eslint with:

    ```bash
    npm install -g eslint
    ```

Or with yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn global add eslint
    ```
